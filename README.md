# Simple chrome extension to block sites and queries on google.

I know this project is super common but I still wanted to do it to get familiar with Svelte.

TODO:

- Add button to set default list of search queries and domains to block.
- Extract chrome storage ids in a seperate file for deduplication.
- Lowercase, sort and deduplicate the queries and domains?
